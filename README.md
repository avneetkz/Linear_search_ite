# Linear_search_ite
This repository finds the element in an array using linear search iterative approach 

# What is linear search 
It is a searching technique which traversed sequentially over each element starting from one until the desired element is found. 

## Code Explanation
Firstly we start with for loop by searching from leftmost of array and comparing each element with the desired value. 
If the element matches with the value, it will return 1 otherwise -1 if the value is not present in array.
